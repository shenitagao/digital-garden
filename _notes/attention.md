# basically

i think that on some basic level, we all crave attention. (or maybe that's just me projecting!!)

let me set the record straight- i'm not talking about attention like i'm-at-the-center-of-the-universe attention.. **that** i absolutely cannot stand. maybe i could handle being that swaggy person in my dreams, but in real life, i would rather die be the central point of attention in any given situation. 

no, what i'm basically trying to say is that i'd like to be someone's [[favourite]] person. NOT counting anyone in my family because they're literally obliged to like me (and what a struggle that is, i must say!!)

i was reading this book, man's search for meaning, i think?? it talks a whole lot about finding meaning in your life and one of the ways that you can find it being finding.. love!! finding someone who sees your potential and actualizes it- i'm paraphrasing, but you get the point. hopefully.

anyways, i get far too bored *way* too easily to commit to a relationship at this point (which is already a joke in itself), but i believe you can still find that same love,, platonically?? and *that* is something i want. 

TLDR: i'm probably just lonely send help lol
