# favourite
spell it the right way. that is all!!

## okay, but seriously!!
i used to be seriously conflicted between spelling favourite with or sans the letter "u". after some serious life experiences and some personal growth, i've come to accept the fact that the correct spelling is, in fact, **favourite**. 

yes, i did use them interchangeably before, but i'm a grown woman now. i am a favourite supporter through and through. it really isn't that much effort to type that extra letter. it longs for your touch!!

there is a u and i in favourite. so why not? accept it with open arms? you know you want to.
