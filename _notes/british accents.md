# more like bri-ish accents, amirite??

but 4 real...

i want a british accent so bad. can you imagine saying the most stupid thing known to man, but being absolved of your sins from merely uttering three words?? it's. chewsday. innit.

i swear that every british person i've met, which is like a grand total of at least five, oozes absolute sophistication. i too, would like a taste of this glory. oh, to walk into a room with my pinky poised up, soaking in the attention of my fellow chaps!!

one day i will move to the united kingdom and get a british accent of my own. you will be able to tell, because then this piece of writing will no longer be a hot mess. it will be a hot, posh mess.

wow. now that i think of it, bri-ish people get to spell and say the word [[favourite]] with utter confidence and eloquence!! now that's what i'd call bloody amazing, luv.
