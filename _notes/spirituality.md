getting all spiritual seems pretty dope. not like, unconscious coupling type spiritual, but more of the bit where you get to gain a more "introspective" view of yourself and the world around you. 

i guess my view of the spiritual world is really through rose-coloured glasses or whatever the saying is because the majority of the 
knowledge" (if you can even call it that) i possess about the topic is through tiktok. and we all know that tiktok is a great source of information. super reliable!! 

BUT i think my desire to get into this stuff mainly stems from the lack of direction i feel like i have in my life. i guess we all just really want something to believe in so we can explain away the bad things that happen in the world and to guarantee that everything will be okay in the end. so maybe even if what i believe in isn't exactly scientifically sound, i shouldn't care. y'know, take it with a grain or salt and all that jazz.

manifestation has been HUGE lately, and for good reason. i mean, who wouldn't want to just think thoughts and get what they want, like that? while i don't exactly buy into it *that* much, what i think it touches on is really important. keep in mind, my manifestation knowledge is also from tiktok and a brief eighth-grade youtube obsession!!

1. you have to embody the person you want to be. #fakeittillyoumakeit, amirite? obviously, this is really standard advice, but it's also easier said than done. sometimes, it is SO hard for me to change my attitude about certain beliefs because i've carried for as long as i can remember. i can say i'm 6'9, but i'd know that i'd be lying to myself. actually, i take that back. i AM 6'9.
2. you've basically created the life you have right now. 
ok. actually, i do have a bit of an issue with this bit because there are most definitely things out of everyone's control and saying that is pretty unfair, to say the least. so let's focus on what IS in your control. unfortunately i can't just manifest everything i want by sleeping in all day. and yes, pretty journaling is fun, but i've gotta actually actively work towards your goals, as well!! which is a key thing i conveniently forget, to this day. so, go me!! 

what am i even trying to say?? i guess that while spirituality can be pretty crystals and 432hz frequencies, it is also about finding yourself and getting yourself to where you want to be. as much as i might make fun of it every now and then, i think it's nice that it gives me and many others a much-needed push to actualize our dreams. plus, i should stop being so judgy when i'm sat here eating a buddha bowl and listening to meditation music.

so, yes, i'll be purchasing the untethered soul soon. thanks for coming to my ted talk.
